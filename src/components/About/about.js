      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Welcome! My name is Krista McPherson.</p>
      <p>
      Full Stack Web Developer with an extensive background in social media marketing and digital strategy looking to combine two unique but complementary skill sets to create a seamless, efficient user and team experience. These two backgrounds give me a special perspective on the user experience from both the front-end and back-end which can be utilized to move customers down the purchase funnel towards conversions. I have a Certificate in Social Media Marketing from Scottsdale Community College, a B.S. in Communications with a minor in Digital Audiences from Arizona State University, and a Certificate in Full-Stack Development from the University of Arizona Coding Bootcamp. These accreditations have sharpened my time management, collaboration, and effective communication skills all while learning the platforms, software, and languages needed to run social campaigns and build applications. I have a passion for content creation and can find numerous ways of connecting with your audience either by social media, website, or app.
